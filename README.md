This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

**Blaze FHIR Server**
This is a FHIR server under development. The initial scope is to support the storage of all the resources required to manage the storage and retrieval of Pathology reports. This scope may be expanded out in time to Pathology Orders and then into the Radiology Report space.
